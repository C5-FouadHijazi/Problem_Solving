/** 
--- Directions
     - Write a program that console logs the numbers from 1 to n
     - For multiples of three print “fizz” instead of the number
     - For the multiples of five print “buzz”
     - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “fizzbuzz”
--- Example
      fizzBuzz(5);
      |  1    |
      |  2    |
      |  fizz |   
      |  4    |
      |  buzz |

const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  // TODO: your code here
